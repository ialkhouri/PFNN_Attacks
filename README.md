# PFNN_Attacks

- This repo has the original and adversarial sequence pushed to AlphFold. We use AlphaFold V2 located at "https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold"

- Our scripts that processes the output pdb files, performs alignment with PyMOL (where the RMSD is also calcaulted), and computes the GDT are provided.
