# PFNN_Attacks

- This repo is for the paper "On the Robustness of Predictive Protein Folding Networks: A Comprehensive Benchmark of AlphaFold and COVID19" submited to the NeurIPS 2022 Dataset and Benchmarks dataset Track  

- We provide the original and adversarial sequences pushed to AlphFold. We use AlphaFold V2 located at "https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold"

- Our scripts that processes the output pdb files, performs alignment with PyMOL (where the RMSD is also calcaulted), and computes the GDT are provided.
