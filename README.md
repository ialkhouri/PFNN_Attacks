# Benchmarking the Robustness of Protein Folding Neural Networks: A COVID-19 Case Study Using AlphaFol

- This repo is for the paper submitted to the NeurIPS 2022 Dataset and Benchmarks dataset Track.  

- We provide the original and adversarial sequences pushed to AlphFold. We use AlphaFold V2 located at "https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold". Samples of the .fasta files used are given inside the Sequences directory. The complete list is given in "https://knightsucfedu39751-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ialkhouri_knights_ucf_edu/Eo53RB9m9upMhisvPyHhNysBDFrUykIpCI2fmyLjIil5qg?e=ptc8MD".

- Our scripts that process the output pdb files, performs alignment with PyMOL (where the RMSD is also calcaulted), and computes the GDT are provided.
