# Exploring The Predictive Capabilities of AlphaFold Using Adversarial Protein Sequences

- This work is published in IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence.

- We provide the original and adversarial sequences pushed to AlphFold. We use AlphaFold V2 located at "https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold". Samples of the .fasta files used are given inside the Sequences directory. 

- We generate sequences using "Find_input_search_space_ofseqs_examples.py". The comments inside the code serve as the guide to generate the adversarial sequences. 

- We process the output PDB files using "processPDB_structure_Distance_COVID.py". Two samples are given inside the "out" directory. Make sure to unzip the folder inside "out". 

- The complete original and adversarial structures for the AlphaFold full configuration are given inside the Aliged_Protein_Structures folder. 

- The requirements to run the scripts are numpy, panda, and PyMOL.
