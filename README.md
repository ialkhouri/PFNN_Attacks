# The Robustness of Protein Folding Neural Networks

- This repo is for the paper submitted to the AAAI 2023 Safe and Robust AI Track.  

- We provide the original and adversarial sequences pushed to AlphFold. We use AlphaFold V2 located at "https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold". Samples of the .fasta files used are given inside the Sequences directory. The complete list is uploaded to the CMT website. 
- Our scripts that process the output pdb files, performs alignment with PyMOL (where the RMSD is also calcaulted), and computes the GDT are provided.
